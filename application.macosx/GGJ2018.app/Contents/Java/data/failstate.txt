You’ve done it! You put yourself out there and asked out your crush. 
I’m proud of you!

You and gh0stykat have a pretty decent time together that weekend at 
the renaissance fair. The two of you are definitely into each other, 
but there’s a big difference between talking online and real life. 

It’s something you’re going to have to work on, but you’re hopeful for the future.

You should really get your keyboard fixed soon though.
