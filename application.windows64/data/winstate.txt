You’ve done it! You put yourself out there and asked out your crush. 
I’m proud of you!

You and gh0stykat have a great time together that weekend at the renaissance fair. 

It’s a great date, and though your relationship is still in its nascent stages, 
you feel like there’s really something there between you two. 
It’ll be exciting to see what happens from here on out.

You should really get your keyboard fixed soon though.
